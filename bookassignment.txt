3. Add a new book

4. Update the new book

5. Delete the new book

6. Search the book by name of the Author

{

   "id": 1,

   "bookName": "Harry Potter",

   "bookAuthor": "JK Rowling",

   "bookQuantity: 4,

   "created_at":"2023-01-09T02:30:20.065Z",

   "updated_at":"2023-01-09T02:39:34.687Z"

}

Instructions: 

All the coding files need to be pushed on github and they should be validated before uploading the link that the project is running on the github. If the project throws an error then it will not be considered a submission. No other file apart from the github link will be accepted for assignment submission.
No extension on the Assignments will be there, all late submissions will only be corrected at a 75% baseline score.
